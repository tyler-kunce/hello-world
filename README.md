# About the Chat App
More people use their phones for daily tasks - shopping, to-do lists, communication (messaging, emails, etc.), and more. This is why more companies offer native mobile versions of their web apps, or skip the web app entirely.
Previously, developing high-quality mobile apps necessitated a lot of time and money in order to deliver the apps across varying platforms (e.g. iOS vs. Android) and, thus, required specialized programmers to build & maintain multiple codebases.
Enter React Native, a framework able to deliver Native-like apps on one codebase. This Chat App leverages said framework to provide users with a messaging interface that's capable of allowing users to share images and their location!
